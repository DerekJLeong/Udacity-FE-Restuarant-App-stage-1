# Udacity Project- Restaurant Review App

Project for Front End Nanodegree.
The project required me to redesign the site using flex css, add proper html accessibility, as well as a service worker to cache
viewed paged for offline use.

### How to run and view

In order to run the application you have some options:

1. Open it [here](https://stearruda.github.io/fend-restaurant-reviews-app/)

2. Run it localy
* Download as .zip file or clone this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/stearruda/fend-restaurant-reviews-app.git
    ```

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
